#Budgie

Studies show that barely a third of all Americans keep a detailed budget, and it's not hard to see why -- keeping track of one's spending habits is often tedious and time-consuming.

But it doesn't have to be.

[Budgie](http://budgie-alpha.herokuapp.com) is a new money management app that combines a sleek, intuitive interface with a rich set of visual tools to make taking charge of your finances both easy and -- dare we say it -- fun.
